[KCAL counter blinks, sound of an alarm clock]
Awoken by the noon light, you wake up in your room. It's saturday.
[Get up]
It's pretty chilly. The fuzz on your arms stand on edge. You consider shaving it.
[Pick up clothes]
Seems like breakfast would be appropriate.
[Leave room]
Before leaving, you stop before the mirror hanging on your door.
Your reflection is a pudgy, pale mess in ill fitting clothes.
[Go to bathroom]
Tossing your clothes on the bathroom floor, you place your feet on the scale.
A bit less since yesterday.
[Go to kitchen]

You get dressed and go upstairs.
Your (parent's) kitchen is newly renovated.
This is your first breakfast in a while.
[Open fridge]
Inside is:
- An egg [70 kcal]
- Bacon [345 kcal]
- Grape fruit [35 kcal]
- Carrot juice [68 kcal]
- Bread [100 kcal]
[Eat breakfast]
You eat your breakfast in the silence of the kitchen.
[Freshen up]

Your teeth are looking brown today. They could use a good brushing.
	[Use toilet]
	Hunkering over the toilet, you put your fingers down your throat.
	Your breakfast eagerly leaves your body. (-kcal)
[Brush teeth]

White Now(TM) is definitely the scam of decade.
You remember you've promised to meet your friend at a coffee shop.

	[Meet friend]
	Some coffee would be good.
	[Go to gym]
	You decide to ditch your friend. Just this once.

While riding the bus to your destination you pick up a newspaper.
There's an article about the latest diet fad.
[Continue reading]
	
	Your friend greets you with a huge hug and a smile to match.
	The coffee shop has a wide array of treats.
	- Coffee [x2 -kcal(?)]
	- Milk [80 kcal]
	- Muffin [315 kcal]
	- Apple [70 kcal]
	[Fika]
	Both of you order and sit down by a table. Your friend goes on about their waist problem. 
	While you eat your food in silence, an endless stream of words pour out of their mouth.
	"But what am I saying? With a body like yours you don't have to worry about that sort of thing"
	You don't appreciate the sarcasm and question coming here.
	[Finish up]
	That coffee went right through you. You excuse yourself and visit the bathroom.
		[Use toilet]
		You go about your business. (-kcal)

	Arriving at the gym, it almost feels like coming home.
	How much cardio do you want to do today?
	- Easy [-320 kcal]
	- Medium [-500 kcal]
	- Tough [-600 kcal]
	[Cardio]
	Light-headed, but satisfied you prepare to leave the gym.
	A bowl of chips is sitting on a table in the lobby.
	"You deserve it!"
	[Take chips] [45 kcal]
		All that work for nothing. [+45 kcal]
	[Leave]

On the bus home your phone rings.

	A somewhat grumpy voice greets you.
	"Where were you? I waited for like an hour.
	"Anyway, my dinner is still on for tonight. Hope you'll show up for that at least."

	A recognizable cheery voice greets you.
	"Hey, I forgot to tell you, my dinner is still on tonight. Can I count on you?"

[Leave excuse]
You really don't feel like you have the energy for socializing.
A somewhat hurt voice:
"Good-bye then"
[Go home]

Finally home. A repulsive smell hits your nostrils.
[Go to your room]
Before you reach the safety of your room, your mother's voice calls from upstairs.
"Honey! You're just in time for dinner."
You shout back that you're not hungry.
"It's your father's birthday, honey. No excuses."
[Well, fuck]

The table is set with the nice china.
A shudder goes through you when you notice what's being served.
	"Geez, honey. You could've changed from your gym clothes."
- Pork chop [246 kcal]
- Boiled potatoes [136 kcal]
- Cream sauce [68 kcal]
- Peas [20 kcal]
Your mother's glance pierces you, a cruel grin on her lips.
	"Oh no, you don't. You're going to eat."
	She begins loading your plate with food.
"You're going to finish every last bit. You have to eat, honey."
Hopefully your blank stare conveys your feelings.

- You cut the porkshop into small pieces.
- You cut the potatoes into small pieces.
- You swirl the sauce around a bit, making sure it doesn't touch anything else
- You eat the peas, the only acceptable thing on the plate

You place some porkshop in your mouth, chewing it fifty times. [+kcal]
You place the potato mush in your mouth, chewing it fifty times. [+kcal]
When there's sufficiently little left on your plate you carefully start mixing what's left together.
After mushing the potatoes, you swirl it in with the sauce.
While your parents are distracted, you gather the remaing pork chop in a pile.
You push as much mush as possible to the pile. You cover it with your fork and knife.
[Ask to be excused]
Hiding the napkin in your hands, you ask to be excused.
"Oh, come on, honey. We're having family time."
Another one of her sick grins distorts her face.
"Don't you want another portion?"
Why does she have to be so mean?
"At least have some dessert?"
[Freshen up]

You go downstairs. The napkin is firmly grasped in your hand.
A click informs you that the bathroom door is firmly locked.
[Use toilet]
Round and round the napkin goes when you flush.
It's mesmerizing.
[Use scale]
More than in the morning. A bit less than yesterday.
Good.
[Go to your room]

 
You put on Breakfast at Tiffany's. It's warm undernearth the bedsheets.
You think about the dessert upstairs.
Time passes. Dessert. The movie isn't helping.
Be strong. Be in control. You don't need it.
Tea might help.
Tea will help.
[Go to kitchen]

The newly renovated kitchen is empty.
Your parents have gone out.
[Open fridge] [Open cupboard]
- Cake [880 kcal]
You get a spoon.
You eat one piece.
You eat another.
You eat another.
You eat another.
There's no cake left.
You drop the spoon to the floor.
[Freshen up]

You almost slip while running down the stairs.
The bathroom door flies open.
[Cleanse yourself]
You stick your fingers down your throat.
Get the poison out.
[Cleanse yourself]
Fingers. Down your throat.
Get it all out.
[Cleanse yourself]
The last bits are coming out.
You cough, clinging to the toilet seat.
Your throat hurts.
[Use scale]
You fat failure.
[Go to your room]
You return to your room. Audrey Hepburn is having a party.
She's wearing a sleeveless dress.
Her arms are beautiful.
You put your fingers around your own arm. The fingertips don't touch.
You set a new goal.
