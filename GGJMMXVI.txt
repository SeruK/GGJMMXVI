Must eat a good breakfast.

Before leaving you stop before the mirror hanging on your door.

White Now(TM) is definitely the scam of decade.
You remember you've promised to meet your friend at a coffee shop.

	[Meet friend]
	Just some coffee.
	[Go to gym]
	You decide to ditch your friend. Just this once.

While riding the bus to your destination you pick up a newspaper.
There's an article about the latest diet fad.
[Continue reading]
	
	Your friend greets you with a big hug and a smile.
	The coffee shop has a wide array of treats.
	- Coffee [x2 -kcal(?)]
	- Milk [80 kcal]
	- Muffin [315 kcal]
	- Apple [70 kcal]
	[Fika]
	Both of you order and sit down by a table. Your friend goes on about their training and diet. 
	While breaking your food into pieces, an endless stream of words pour out of their mouth.
	"If only I had a body like yours I wouldn't have to think about this stuff!"
	You don't appreciate the sarcasm and question coming here.
	[Finish up]
	That coffee went right through you. You excuse yourself and visit the bathroom.

	[Leave]

On the bus home your phone rings.

	A somewhat grumpy voice greets you.
	"Where were you? I waited for like an hour.
	"Anyway, my dinner is still on for tonight. Hope you'll show up for that at least."

	A recognizable cheery voice greets you.
	"Hey, I forgot to tell you, my dinner is still on tonight. Can I count on you?"

[Leave excuse]
You really don't feel like you have the energy for socializing.
Your friend sounds let down.
"Good-bye then"
[Go home]

Finally home. A repulsive smell hits your nostrils.
[Go to your room]
Before you reach the safety of your room, your mother's voice calls from upstairs.
"Honey! You're just in time for dinner."
You shout back that you're not hungry.
"It's your father's birthday, honey. Come to the dining room."
[Well, fuck]

The table is set with the nice china.
Your stomach turns when you notice what's being served.
	"Geez, honey. You could've changed from those ugly gym clothes."
- Pork chop [246 kcal]
- Boiled potatoes [136 kcal]
- Cream sauce [68 kcal]
- Peas [20 kcal]
Your mother's glance pierces you, a cruel grin on her lips.
	"Have some more, honey."
	She begins loading your plate with food.
"You're going to finish every last bit. You have to eat, honey."
Hopefully your blank stare conveys your feelings.

- You cut the porkshop into small pieces.
- You cut the potatoes into small pieces.
- You swirl the sauce around a bit, making sure it doesn't touch anything else
- You eat the peas, the only acceptable thing on the plate

You place some porkshop in your mouth, chewing it fifty times. [+kcal]
You place the potato mush in your mouth, chewing it fifty times. [+kcal]
When there's sufficiently little left on your plate you carefully start mixing what's left together.
You leave blank spots on the plate so it looks empty.
After mushing the potatoes, you swirl it in with the sauce.
While your parents are distracted, you gather the remaing pork chop in a pile.
You push as much mush as possible to the pile. You cover it with your fork and knife.
[Ask to be excused]
Hiding the napkin in your hands, you ask to be excused.
"Please, we hardly spend any time together nowadays."
Another one of her sick grins distorts her face.
You tell her you're not hungry and need to rest.
The napkin with the food is burning in your clenched grip.
"Have some more food, sweetie. You're so small."
Why does she have to be so mean?
"At least stay for dessert. I made your favorite cake."
Why is she taunting me?
You decline.
[Freshen up]

You go downstairs. The napkin is firmly grasped in your hand.
You lock the door and turn on the sink.
[Use toilet]
You flush. Round and round the food-filled napkin dances.
It's mesmerizing.
You're proud.
[Use scale]
Same as in the morning.
You are in control.
[Go to your room]

 
You put on Breakfast at Tiffany's. It's warm undernearth the bedsheets.
You think about the dessert upstairs.
Time passes. Dessert. The movie isn't helping.
Be strong. Be in control. You don't need it.
Tea might help.
Tea will help.

The newly renovated kitchen is empty.
Your parents have gone out.
[Open fridge] [Open cupboard]

The bathroom door flies open.
[Cleanse yourself]
Turn the sink on.
You stick your fingers down your throat.
Get the poison out.
[Cleanse yourself]
Fingers further down your throat.
Get it all out.
[Cleanse yourself]
You keep going until barely anything comes out.
You cough, clinging to the toilet seat.
Your throat hurts.
[Use scale]
You fat failure.
[Go to your room]
You return to your room. Audrey Hepburn is having a party.
She's wearing a sleeveless dress.
Her arms are beautiful.
You put your fingers around your own arm. The fingertips don't touch.
You set a new goal.
